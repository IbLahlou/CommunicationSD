# REST Programming with JavaScript and Axios

## Overview

REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications, commonly used for building APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). JavaScript is a versatile programming language that can be used both on the client-side (browser) and server-side (Node.js). Axios is a popular JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests, making it an excellent choice for REST programming. This README provides an overview of REST programming with JavaScript and how to use Axios to interact with RESTful APIs.

## REST Basics

RESTful APIs are built around the concept of resources, which can be any information that can be named, addressed, or manipulated. RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on these resources.

## Using Axios for REST Programming

Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for JavaScript that runs on both the browser and Node.js environments. It provides a simple and intuitive way to make HTTP requests, making it an ideal choice for interacting with RESTful APIs.

### Installation

To use Axios, install it via npm (Node Package Manager) or include it in your HTML file as a script.

```bash
# If using npm (Node.js environment)
npm install axios
```

```html
<!-- If using Axios in the browser -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
```
After this we can use the REST CRUD using GET POST PUT & DELETE for example

## Conclusion

REST programming is a popular approach for building APIs and interacting with resources over the internet. JavaScript, with its widespread use and versatility, is an excellent language for REST programming. Axios simplifies making HTTP requests, allowing developers to easily perform CRUD operations and interact with RESTful APIs.
